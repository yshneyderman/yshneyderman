## Hello World!

I am a student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science. 

I'm very interested in learning about and working on software engineering/development, security, artificial intelligence/machine learning, sustainability, and UX/UI design. I love learning and am always interested in trying out new things and working on all sorts of projects with others.

Contact me with any method if you want to team up or collaborate on a project or just want to say hello.
