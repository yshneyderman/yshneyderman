## Hello World!

I am a student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with concentration in Mathematical Computing. 

I am primarily interested in software engineering/development, security, graphic design, sustainability, and UX/UI design, but I am exploring my other interests in computer science as well. I love learning and am always interested in trying out new things and working on all sorts of projects with others.

Contact me with any method if you want to team up or collaborate on a project or just want to say hello.
